Predicting Heart Disease Risk Using Machine Learning
📖 Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can save lives and reduce healthcare costs.
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict the risk of heart disease using clinical and demographic data such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and lifestyle factors.
To create an ML model that accurately predicts whether a person is at risk of heart disease.
The project demonstrates the full data-science workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and interpretation.
